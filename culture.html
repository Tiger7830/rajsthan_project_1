        <div class="pera_1">
            <p>The architecture of the Indian state of Rajasthan has usually been a regional variant of the style of Indian architecture prevailing in north India at the time. Rajasthan is especially notable for the forts and palaces of the many Rajput rulers, which are popular tourist attractions.

                Most of the population of Rajasthan is Hindu, and there has historically been a considerable Jain minority; this mixture is reflected in the many temples of the region. Māru-Gurjara architecture, or "Solaṅkī style" is a distinctive style that began in Rajasthan and neighbouring Gujarat around the 11th century, and has been revived and taken to other parts of India and the world by both Hindus and Jains. This represents the main contribution of the region to Hindu temple architecture. The Dilwara Jain Temples of Mount Abu built between the 11th and 13th centuries CE are the best-known examples of this style.

        <div class="pera_1">
            <p>Rajasthani cuisine is the cuisine of the rugged Rajasthan region in North 
                West India. It was influenced by both the warlike lifestyles of its inhabitants
                 and the availability of ingredients in an arid region. Food that could last for 
                 several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. Scarcity of
                  water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking. 
                  It is also known for its snacks like Bikaneri bhujia, Mirchi bada and Pyaaj kachori.
                   Other famous dishes include Dal Baati, malaidar special lassi (lassi) and Lashun ki 
                   chutney (hot garlic paste), Mawa lassi from Jodhpur, Alwar ka mawa, Malpauas from 
                   Pushkar and rasgulla from Bikaner, "paniya"and "gheriya" from Mewar.
                    Originating for the Marwar region of the state is the concept Marwari Bhojnalaya,
                     or vegetarian restaurants, today found in many parts of India, which offer vegetarian
                      food of the Marwari people. The history also has its effect on the diet as the Rajputs
                       preferred majorly a non-vegetarian diet while the Brahmin, Jains, and others preferred 
                       a vegetarian diet. So, the state has a myriad of both types of delicacies.
